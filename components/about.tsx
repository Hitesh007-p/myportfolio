              Hello! I'm Hitesh Patil, a passionate Flutter developer with a keen interest in creating beautiful and
              functional mobile applications. My journey in app development started with a fascination for creating
              seamless user experiences across different platforms.

            {/* <p>
              Currently, I'm interning at [Company Name], where I'm honing my skills in Flutter development and learning
              the intricacies of building production-ready applications. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack
              mobile developer, capable of taking an app from concept to deployment.

              I'm particularly passionate about leveraging Flutter's capabilities to create performant, visually
              appealing apps that solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest
              trends in mobile development or contributing to open-source projects.
