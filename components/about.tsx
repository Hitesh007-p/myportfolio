              Hello! I'm <span className="font-semibold">Hitesh Patil</span>, a passionate Flutter developer with a keen interest in creating beautiful and
              functional mobile applications. My journey in app development started with a fascination for creating
              seamless user experiences across different platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm particularly passionate about leveraging Flutter's capabilities to build performant, visually
              appealing apps that solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest
              trends in mobile development or contributing to open-source projects.
